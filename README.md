# Python_project
This is a python project to track someone location with phonenumber. 

In this project I used phonenumbers library to parse a phone number and then use the parsed information to obtain the location and carrier details. Additionally, I also used the OpenCage Geocoding API and Folium to visualize the location on a map.
